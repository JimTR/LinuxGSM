[LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com) is the command-line tool for quick, simple deployment and management of Linux dedicated game servers.

## Hassle-Free Dedicated Game Servers

Traditionally game servers are not easy to manage yourself. Admins often have to spend hours messing around trying to get their server working. LinuxGSM is a command-line tool designed to be as simple as possible, allowing admins to spend less time on management and more time gaming.

## Main features

100+ game servers supported
